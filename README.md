### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mathieu Poirier and I'm a computer science student at the University of Windsor. Here's some information about me.

How did I end up here?

I've been enjoying software development (especially in Python) since I realized it serves as a great way to provide creative solutions to data-oriented problems. I'm currently looking for a role in data science/analysis ideally writing Python code. I'd especially love to work in companies that have amazing training and clear development goals. If you're hiring, let's chat!
