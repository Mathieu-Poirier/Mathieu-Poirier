### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mathieu Poirier and I'm a computer science student at the University of Windsor. Here's some information about me.

How did I end up here?

I've been enjoying web development since I realized I could make websites that tailored to my custom design principals (minimalist yet powerful). I appreciate Flask's simple to use, yet expressive endpoints and React's component system. I'm currently looking for a role in fullstack web development, ideally writing Python, Javascript/Typescript or C#. I'd especially love to work in companies that have amazing training and clear development goals. If you're hiring, let's chat! 

Highlighted projects
