### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mathieu Poirier and I'm a computer science student at the University of Windsor. Here's some information about me.

How did I end up here?

I've been enjoying web development since I realized I could make websites that did what you needed them to and nothing you didn't. I appreciate Flask's simple to use, yet expressive endpoints, React's router and C#'s love of dependency injection. I'm currently looking for a role in fullstack web development, ideally writing Python, Javascript/Typescript or C#. I'd especially love to work in companies that have amazing training and clear development goals. If you're hiring, let's chat! 

Highlighted projects
- Website that can host real-time graphs that showcase efficiency metrics about an assembly line: (D3.js, WebSocket.js, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Angular, Keyboard Scanner, Python)
- Password manager website with user authentication through Flask-login and hashing: (Flask, React, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS)

Currently learning
- Google Firebase
- Building libraries in C#
- Docker
- React-Native
