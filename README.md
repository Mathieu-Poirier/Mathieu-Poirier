### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mathieu Poirier and I'm a computer science student at the University of Windsor. Here's some information about me.

How did I end up here?

My brain was uniquely wired to find computers interesting and I enjoy abstract problem solving as a tool for creative expression. I enjoy writing C, C++, and Python in systems programming contexts.
