Hey I'm Mathieu. I'm a computer science student from Windsor, ON.

My professional interests lie in low-level software and software-to-hardware interfacing, with a particular focus on operating systems and kernel development, including bootloaders, device drivers, rollback filesystems, and system utilities with clear and responsive user interfaces. My goal is to build fast, reliable systems that balance performance with ease of use, never sacrificing clarity in design.

Outside of work, you can find me in the gym working on my pull-ups. Reading overcomplicated philosophy books and practicing the visual arts as a creative outlet.
